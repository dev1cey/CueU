Summary: Development Server Connection Issue
The Problem
The app showed "Could not connect to development server" when trying to load the JavaScript bundle from Metro.
Root Causes
Development build vs Expo Go mismatch
The app is a development build (has native iOS/Android code from expo prebuild)
It cannot run in Expo Go; it requires a custom development build
Using npm start and pressing i tried to use Expo Go, which is incompatible
Build failure
Missing codegen files for react-native-gesture-handler (needed for New Architecture)
Caused by corrupted CocoaPods state after pod deintegrate
Metro URL mismatch
Metro was binding to the network IP (10.0.0.144:8081)
The app expected localhost:8081
In the iOS simulator, localhost should work, but the mismatch caused connection failures
The Fix
Regenerated CocoaPods dependencies
   cd ios   pod install
This restored the missing codegen files and fixed the build.
Updated Metro to bind to localhost
Modified package.json:
"start": "expo start --localhost"
   "start": "expo start --localhost"
This ensures Metro binds to localhost:8081, matching what the simulator expects.
Used the correct workflow
Run npm start in one terminal (starts Metro on localhost)
Run npm run ios in another terminal (builds and launches the development build)
The development build connects to the Metro server on localhost
Key Takeaway
Development builds require expo run:ios (not Expo Go), and Metro must bind to localhost for the iOS simulator to connect properly.


Newer thing that works:

1. Run npm install -g expo-cli to install the latest Expo CLI globally.
2. Delete your project node_modules directory and package-lock.json file
3. Run npm install
4. If has conflict just send to cursor
